                    <h2>Ugly UI Can Have a Positive UX</h2>
                    <p class="fade wave3">Visual design can be appealing and lead to positive user experience. As in the site, UXMyths, “Attractive things work better. Studies show that emotions play an important role in the users’ experience. If a website has a pleasant visual design, users are more relaxed, tend to find the website more credible and easier to use. A positive first impression — usually based on looks rather than interaction — determines the value of the website on the user’s behalf.” The aesthetics of an application can add to overall impression a user gets. It leaves behind a more positive emotional impact, compared to an application lacking visual appeal. Furthermore, a pleasant appearance may make an application more usable, such as having fonts and colors that showcase important information and actions. </p>
                    <p class="fade wave3">However, even if a user interface is not as aesthetically pleasing, an application can still be easy to use and leave a positive emotion. There are many other factors than affect a user’s experience. Five principles of great UX, according to Adobe, are consistency, preceivability, learnability, predictability, and feedback. Visually appealing interfaces may play a role in helping facilitate a great user experience, but so can visually unappealing interfaces. For example Websites, like Reddit, have a plain user interface, but provide strong enough user experience in features and content. </p>
                    <p class="fade wave3">Furthermore an appealing user interface might not always lead to a pleasant user experience. Voice recognition software, such as Siri or Cortana, almost always has a simple and clean user interface. However, the recognition of what a person says may not be as accurate, which would lead a frustrating user experience, trying to get a machine accustomed to an accent or a lisp. A beautiful user interface does not necessarily mean that a user experience will be positive.</p>
                    <p class="fade wave3">Even outside digital technology, physical objects can have a similar dynamic. For example, consider someone looking to buy a house. Some houses are designed by professionals to be beautiful and elegant. Other homes may not be as aesthetically pleasing. But other factors, such as the neighborhood, the schools, and entertainment venues may make the less visually appealing house a better experience to live in. Overall aesthetics and a beautiful user interface is only one factor in a wide range of aspects that can affect a user’s experience. </p>
